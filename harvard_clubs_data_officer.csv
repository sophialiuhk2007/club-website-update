36114,The Harvard Undergraduate Ichthus,Religious and Spiritual Life,,https://soco.college.harvard.edu/257967/,,Editor in Chief: McGowin Grinstead; Officer: Justin Dunning; Publisher: Caleb Chung,"The Harvard Ichthus is a journal of Christian thought.  It exists for the purpose of fostering deep Christian thought among the members of the Harvard community, taking seriously the motto of Harvard University: “Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae,” in English “Truth for Christ and the Church.”  It adopts these words of the Rev. Prof. Peter J. Gomes, preached at the Memorial Church, as its mission statement:  ""There is a rumor about, and fanned in certain quarters, that this University has long since abandoned its ancient motto and is conformable only  to ‘Veritas.’  That simply is not true.  The seal by which the President and  Fellows of Harvard College continue to conduct their business is still the seal that says: ‘Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae.’  One cannot undo the past, and in this particular case one should not undo the past. The university-- and this University in particular-- is in the business of goodness and virtue  personified, and not simply in the bottom lines of fairness and excellence.    Christ and the Church were an essential part of that truth to which Harvard and the generations of its children were committed.  ...Truth for Christ and the Church is not here by accident or by sufferance; it is here by design and intent.  ...Indeed, as a symbol of Christian truth, we are here to remind  Harvard of a dimension beyond its own self-interest and self-perception... We Christians must never forget, nor must we permit our College or our University ever to forget, that knowledge without virtue is a destructive danger that produces arrogant technocrats who are a danger to all that is holy, hopeful, lovely, and true, and who must be resisted.  Our pious ancestors understood this, and thus they dedicated this small, fragile College in the wilderness to a truth that was seen in and for Christ and the Church.  Veritas-- that is, true Veritas, and not simply correct information-- can never be separated from the one in whom it is most perfectly and fully seen: Jesus Christ.  Not everyone may believe that, but those of us who do must not be intimidated by those who don't, and we must be emboldened to claim that truth not only as our own but as one that is essential to the definition of a University and College worthy of the name.""  (Strength for the Journey, pgs. 56, 60)",,,
